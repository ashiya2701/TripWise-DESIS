## Summary
Tripwise is a complete trip planner with an expense distributor during the trip which handles the trip smoothly between a group. Our web app suggests the fastest and the cheapest flight option, reasonable hotel suggestions which are in the vicinity of arrival or departure mediums, a well planned itinerary to visit all the major tourist attractions in the best possible way. The user can also create trip groups to manage splitting of expenses between the co-travelers. We wish to improve the features, populate more data and scale the application.
