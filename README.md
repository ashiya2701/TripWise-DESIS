# TripWise-DESIS
Tripwise is a complete trip planner with an expense distributor during the trip which handles the trip smoothly between people. Users create a trip and select the desired time, location, and itinerary of the trip. Our App suggests the places to visit, best possible route, mode of travel, hotels, and itinerary according to major events of the venue. Along with managing the trip, it also manages splitting expenses between the co-travelers added to the trip. This is done with the help of a maintained expense log for each user which also keeps an account of money lent and borrowed.
